👋 Hello, I'm Sithulisiwe Peko!

🌄 Passionate hiker, gym enthusiast, and avid programmer with a National Diploma in Information Technology from Walter Sisulu University.

💼 Previously worked at CapaCiti UVU Africa, where I honed my skills in Frontend, Backend, and UI/UX Design.

🎨 Balancing creativity through music, cooking, and baking, I find joy in exploring diverse interests. Whether it's hitting the trails or experimenting with new recipes, I believe in the power of pursuing passions beyond the screen.

🌱 Continuously seeking personal and professional growth, I thrive in social activities like pool table and networking events, where I connect with like-minded individuals and foster new opportunities.
